# Palindrome Checker üîç

This project is a simple web application that checks if a word or phrase entered by the user is a palindrome. It was developed as part of the freeCodeCamp course.

## Features ‚ú®

- **User Input**: Enter any word or phrase in the text box.
- **Palindrome Check**: The app checks if the input is a palindrome once the "Check" button is pressed.
- **Ignores Punctuation, Case, and Spacing**: The app automatically ignores spaces, punctuation (e.g., `.` and `?`), and converts everything to lowercase to perform the check.

## Technologies Used üíª

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styles for the page.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for the palindrome check.

## User Instructions üìö
